          If you're a contractor shopping for a website, you've probably seen prices from $500 to $15,000. What's the right price? Let's break it down.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">The Real Cost Breakdown</h2>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">Pricing Ranges Explained</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-6 mb-3">$0-$500: Template Sites</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Wix, Squarespace, GoDaddy website builders. You get what you pay for. These look cheap, load slow, and you're stuck fixing them yourself when something breaks. Not worth your time.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-6 mb-3">$500-$2,000: The Sweet Spot ⭐</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          This is where you get a professional site that actually works. Clean design, mobile-friendly, loads fast. This is what 90% of contractors need. At SiteBloom, we're at $299 setup + $15/month because we've streamlined the process.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-6 mb-3">$2,000-$5,000: Custom Features</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Only worth it if you need online booking, payment processing, customer portals, or complex integrations. Most contractors don't need this.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-6 mb-3">$5,000+: Enterprise/Agency Pricing</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          You're paying for account managers, multiple revision rounds, and premium agency overhead. Unless you're a national franchise, skip it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">What You Should Actually Pay</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          For a local contractor, plumber, HVAC company, or similar business, you should pay <strong class="text-sb-orange">$300-$1,500 upfront</strong> and <strong class="text-sb-orange">$10-$50/month</strong> for hosting and maintenance.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-sb-orange rounded-r-xl p-6 my-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-sb-ink mb-3">💡 Pro Tip</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Your website should pay for itself with ONE job. If it costs $500 and you make $2,000+ per job, it's a no-brainer investment.
          </p>

            <span class="text-red-500 font-bold text-xl">🚩</span>

          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-red-500 font-bold text-xl">🚩</span>
            <span><strong>"SEO packages" for $500/month</strong> - Most local businesses don't need this</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-red-500 font-bold text-xl">🚩</span>
            <span><strong>Multi-year contracts</strong> - Technology changes fast, don't lock yourself in</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          A good contractor website should cost <strong>$300-$1,500 to build</strong> and <strong>$15-$50/month to maintain</strong>. Anything less is probably a template you'll hate. Anything more is probably unnecessary.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          The goal isn't to have the fanciest website. The goal is to have a site that makes your phone ring and books you jobs. That's it.

          You're great at landscaping. But if you don't have a website in 2024, you're leaving money on the table. Here's exactly how.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">1. People Google You and Find Your Competition Instead</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Someone searches "landscaper near me" or "lawn care in [your town]". Your competitor with a website shows up. You don't. They get the call. You lose $500-$2,000 per job.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 rounded-r-xl p-6 my-6">
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            <strong class="text-red-600">Reality check:</strong> 97% of people search online before hiring a local service. If you're not there, you're invisible.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">2. You Look Less Professional Than You Are</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          "Just check out my Facebook page" makes you sound like a hobby business, not a professional company. Even if your work is incredible, perception matters.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          People hiring for $5,000+ landscaping projects want to see a real business. A website = legitimacy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">3. You Miss After-Hours Leads</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          It's 8pm. Someone's planning their spring landscaping. They find three companies online. Two have websites with contact forms. One doesn't.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Guess who gets the inquiry? <strong>Not you.</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="bg-sb-orange/5 border border-sb-orange/20 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-sb-ink mb-3">📊 The Math:</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            If you get 2 extra inquiries per month from after-hours website visitors, and you close 1 of them at $1,500... that's <strong class="text-sb-orange">$18,000/year</strong> from leads who would've gone to someone else.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">4. Referrals Can't Find Your Contact Info</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Your happy customer tells their neighbor about you. The neighbor googles your business name. They find... nothing. Or worse, outdated info.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Frustrated, they move on to the next company. You just lost a pre-qualified, warm lead.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">5. You Can't Show Your Best Work Easily</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Before/after photos are your best sales tool. But on Facebook, they get buried in the feed. On Instagram, people have to scroll through your life updates to find them.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          A website puts your best work front and center. No algorithms, no distractions, just your killer portfolio.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">The Truth About "I Get Enough Business From Word of Mouth"</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Great! But here's the thing: even word-of-mouth customers google you before calling.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          No website = no credibility check = no confidence = no call.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">Problem #1: Facebook Doesn't Show Up in Google</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          When someone's AC breaks at 9pm and they google "emergency HVAC repair near me," Facebook pages rarely show up in results.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Real websites do. Your competitors with websites get that emergency call. You don't.

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 rounded-r-xl p-6 my-6">

          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">Problem #2: Facebook Makes You Look Unprofessional</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          You're competing for $8,000 HVAC installations. The homeowner is comparing 3-4 companies.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Company A: Professional website with clear pricing, service areas, certifications<br/>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Who looks like the real business?</strong> Not Company C.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">Problem #3: You Don't Control Your Facebook Page</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Facebook owns your page. They can change how it looks, what shows up, who sees your posts, or even shut it down.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Your website? You own it. Nobody can take it away or change the rules on you.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">Problem #4: Facebook Isn't Built for Service Businesses</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          What people need when looking for HVAC service:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-sb-orange font-bold">→</span>

          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-sb-orange font-bold">→</span>
            <span>Services you offer (maintenance, repair, installation)</span>
          </li>

            <span class="text-sb-orange font-bold">→</span>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Good luck making that clear and prominent on a Facebook page buried between your weekend BBQ photos.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">Problem #5: Facebook's Algorithm Hides Your Posts</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          You post about your winter maintenance special. Facebook shows it to 12 people. Maybe.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Your website? When someone visits, they see EVERYTHING. Your services, your offers, your contact info. No algorithm deciding what they get to see.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">But What About Lead Generation Ads?</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Most plumbing websites overcomplicate things. Here's the only checklist you need - 10 things that actually get you more calls.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">1. Your Phone Number is HUGE</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Not in the footer. Not hidden in a menu. Right at the top, impossible to miss, click-to-call on mobile.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          When someone's toilet is overflowing, they don't want to hunt for your contact info.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">2. Emergency Service is Clear</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          If you offer 24/7 emergency service, that needs to be the FIRST thing people see. Emergency calls = premium rates.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">3. Service Area Listed</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          People need to know if you serve their town. List it clearly: "Serving Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, and surrounding areas."
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">4. Services in Plain English</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Not "comprehensive residential plumbing solutions." Just:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-sb-orange font-bold">•</span>
            <span>Leak Repair</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-sb-orange font-bold">•</span>
            <span>Drain Cleaning</span>

            <span>Emergency Repairs</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">5. Mobile-Friendly (Actually Test It)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          70% of plumbing searches happen on phones. Pull out your phone and test your site right now. Can you easily:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-sb-orange">✓</span>
            <span>Read the text without zooming</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-sb-orange">✓</span>
            <span>Tap the call button</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-sb-orange">✓</span>
            <span>Find your service area</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">6. Trust Signals</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          People are letting you into their homes. Show them you're legit:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-sb-orange">•</span>
            <span>Licensed & Insured (with license number)</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-sb-orange">•</span>
            <span>Years in business</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-sb-orange">•</span>
            <span>Customer reviews (Google, Yelp, etc.)</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">7. Fast Load Time</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, people bounce. Test it at <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev" class="text-sb-orange underline">PageSpeed Insights</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">8. Contact Form That Works</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Keep it simple: Name, Phone, Issue. That's it. Don't ask for their life story.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          And TEST IT. So many plumbers have broken contact forms and don't know it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">9. Real Photos (Not Stock)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Nobody believes stock photos. Show your actual truck, your actual team, actual work you've done.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-sb-ink mt-8 mb-4">10. Google Business Profile Linked</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Your website should link to your Google Business Profile (and vice versa). This helps local SEO and gives people more trust signals.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-sb-orange rounded-r-xl p-6 my-8">

          <p class="text-gray-700">
