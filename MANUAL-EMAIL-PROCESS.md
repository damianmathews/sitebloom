## Checking Submissions in Netlify

Anytime you want to see who submitted:

1. Netlify dashboard → **Forms**
2. Click on **resource-download** form
3. See all submissions with:
   - Email address
   - Resource requested
   - Date/time
4. Export to CSV if needed

## How Many Submissions To Expect

Typical conversion rates:
- **Blog traffic:** 2-5% will download
- **Direct traffic:** 10-20% will download

If you get 100 visitors to your resources page, expect 5-10 downloads.

## When To Automate

Consider Zapier automation when:
- You're getting 5+ submissions per day
- You're spending more than 30 min/day on manual emails
- You want to focus on higher-value tasks

Until then, manual is perfectly fine and keeps you connected to your leads!

## Questions?

Your setup is ready to go. Forms will work as soon as you:
1. Deploy to Netlify
2. Enable email notifications
3. Start getting submissions

The forms are already configured - no additional code needed!
