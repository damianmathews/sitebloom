# Traffic Generation Strategy for SiteBloom

Your target: Local service business owners (contractors, plumbers, HVAC, landscapers, etc.)

## High-ROI Traffic Sources (Prioritized)

### 🔥 Tier 1: Free & Fast (Start This Week)

#### 1. Facebook Groups (HIGHEST ROI for B2B Local Services)

**Why It Works:** Your exact customers hang out in industry groups asking for help.

**Where to Post:**
- "Small Business Owners" groups (10k-50k members)
- "Contractor Business Growth"
- "Plumbing Business Owners"
- "HVAC Technicians & Business Owners"
- "Landscaping Business Success"
- "Home Service Business Owners"
- "Local Business Marketing"

**What to Post:**

**Don't:** "Hey, I build websites! Check out my service!"
**Do:** Share your blog posts as helpful content

**Example Post #1:**
```
Just wrote a guide on contractor website costs for 2025.

TL;DR: If you're paying more than $1,500 for a basic site, you're overpaying.

Most contractors need:
- Mobile-friendly design
- Click-to-call phone number
- Contact form
- Service area listed
- That's it.

Full breakdown here: [link to blog post]

Hope this helps someone avoid getting ripped off 👊
```

**Example Post #2:**
```
Saw someone asking about websites yesterday...

Here's the brutal truth: Your Facebook page is costing you jobs.

Why?
- Doesn't show up in Google
- Looks unprofessional for $5k+ projects
- Misses after-hours leads
- Can't show your best work effectively

Wrote a full breakdown: [link to blog post]

Not trying to sell anything - just tired of seeing good contractors lose work to worse ones with better websites.
```

**Strategy:**
- Post 2-3x per week across 5-10 groups
- Focus on helping, not selling
- Link to your blog posts (not directly to pricing)
- Respond to every comment
- Add value in other people's threads

**Time Investment:** 30 min/day
**Expected Results:** 50-100 website visitors/week, 2-5 leads/month

---

#### 2. Reddit (Underrated for B2B)

**Subreddits to Target:**
- r/smallbusiness (1M+ members)
- r/Entrepreneur (3M+ members)
- r/sweatystartup (200k+ members)
- r/contractors
- r/HVAC
- r/landscaping
- r/electricians
- r/Plumbing

**What Works:**
- Answer questions about websites
- Share blog posts when relevant
- Don't be salesy - Redditors hate that

**Example Comment:**
```
Someone asks: "Should I pay $5k for a website?"

Your answer:
"Former dev here. For a local service business, $5k is way too much unless you need custom features.

You really only need:
- Mobile responsive
- Contact form
- Your services listed
- Fast loading

Should cost $300-$1,500 max. I wrote a breakdown here: [link]

Happy to answer specific questions."
```

**Time Investment:** 20 min/day
**Expected Results:** 30-50 visitors/week, 1-3 leads/month

---

#### 3. LinkedIn (Best for Credibility)

**Strategy:**
- Post your blog articles
- Share insights from helping clients
- Connect with local business owners
- Comment on small business posts

**What to Post:**

**Monday:** Share blog post
```
Most contractors waste money on websites.

Here's what you actually need (and what you don't):

✅ Need: Mobile-first design (70% browse on phone)
✅ Need: Click-to-call button
✅ Need: Contact form
❌ Don't need: Blog
❌ Don't need: Complex animations
❌ Don't need: 10-page "about us"

Full guide: [link]
```

**Wednesday:** Share a win (social proof)
```
Just launched a site for an HVAC company.

48 hours from call to live.
$299 + $15/month.
No upsells, no BS.

They got their first lead 2 days later. $8k job.

This is why I love working with local service businesses.
```

**Friday:** Answer a question
```
Saw someone asking about website costs...

For local service businesses:
- $0-500: DIY template (looks cheap, you're on your own)
- $500-1500: Sweet spot for most (professional, fast)
- $2k-5k: Only if you need custom features
- $5k+: Agency overhead (rarely needed)

Most plumbers/contractors should be in the $500-1500 range.

Don't let agencies convince you otherwise.
```

**Time Investment:** 15 min/day
**Expected Results:** 20-40 visitors/week, builds credibility

---

#### 4. Local Business Meetups & Networking

**In-Person Events:**
- Chamber of Commerce meetings
- BNI (Business Networking International)
- Local entrepreneur meetups
- Industry trade shows (HVAC, construction, etc.)

**Your Pitch (30 seconds):**
```
"I build websites specifically for contractors and local service businesses.

The thing is, most web designers overcomplicate it and charge too much.

I strip it down to what actually books jobs - mobile-friendly, fast,
contact form, done in 48 hours for $299.

If you know a contractor losing work to competitors with better websites,
send them my way."
```

**Follow-Up:**
- Hand out business cards with your website
- Connect on LinkedIn
- Send them a helpful resource (your checklist)

**Time Investment:** 2-4 hours/week (1-2 events)
**Expected Results:** 1-3 quality leads per event

---

### 🎯 Tier 2: Paid & Scalable (Month 2-3)

```
